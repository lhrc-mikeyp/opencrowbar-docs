# Dev System Configuration

## Installation and Configuration Overview - What you'll be doing:

1. Install the base OS
2. Configure base OS for running Crowbar
3. git clone https://github.com/opencrowbar/core
4. Start crowbar in a Docker container
5. Deploy slave nodes and Hack away!

## Prereqs

You'll need (or end up with after following these docs):

* A Linux development environment (running on bare metal or VirtualBox)
* Internet Access
* Your own user (NOT ROOT)
* Several Networks:
  * Crowbar relies on a few private networks - they can all be on the same NIC, bridges, or whatever.
* Recommended: a local caching proxy server - we download a lot.

# OK, let's get started setting up the development environemnt:

## What's your platform?

### Virtual Machine Setup

* [VirtualBox](virtualbox.md) based installations - network configs and basic install info
* [KVM on Ubuntu](kvm-ubuntu.md)
* [KVM on Fedora Core 19](kvm-fedora.md)

## O/S configs

Makes sure you have development O/S on the Virtual Machine or bare metal.  Also, get the docker stuff all configured properly:

* [Ubuntu 12.04.03](dev-ubuntu-12.04.03.md)
* [CentOS 6.5](dev-centos-6.5.md)
* [Fedora Core 19](dev-Fedora.md)
* [SUSE](dev-vm-SUSE.md)
* [OpenSUSE Images](openSUSE-images.md)

##Setup Docker Admin Node 
  1. follow steps in [docker-admin.md](docker-admin.md)

###Deploy Nodes!  

Now that you've got Crowbar installed, it's time to look in the [Deployment Guide](../../deployment-guide/README.md) for instructions about provisioning nodes.

###Change to Crowbar user
  1. `su - crowbar` to gain ruby-2.0 and control Crowbar via the CLI!
  1. we've provided a handle `tools/rails-console` command if you want to reach deep into the bowels of the bunny.
