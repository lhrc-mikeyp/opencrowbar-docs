## Role Model

### Conflicts

A role can declare that it conflicts with another role via the
conflicts stanza.  Roles that conflict with one another cannot be
deployed to the same node at the same time -- any attempt to do so
will cause the Crowbar framework to throw a 409.

### Provides

Via the provides stanza, a role can declare that it can be used in
place of another role.  However, a role that provides another role is
subject to a couple of restrictions:

* Roles in a provides relationship automatically conflict with
  another.  If role x provides y, then y and x cannot be bound on the
  same node.
* Roles in a provides relationship cannot be have a direct or indirect
parent/child relationship in the noderole graph.

Trying to bind roles to nodes in a way that would violate these
constraints will result in a 409.

Additionally, when a role provides another role then any attributes
from the provided role can be utilized as if they were also declared
on the providing role.

### Flags

Roles have several flags that detemrine how OpenCrowbar manages
relationships when creating the node-role graph.

#### implicit

Any role that depends on a parent role with the implicit flag will
automatically bind a noderole for the parent role to the same node.

#### bootstrap

Indicates that this role will be automatically bound to the first admin node.

You only need to do this to a few roles (by default, crowbar-admin-node)
because the role dependency logic flags will take care of the rest of
the bindings.

#### discovery

Indicates that this role will be automatically bound to all newly
discovered nodes.

"crowbar-managed-node" is the only one that uses this by default, and
we let the binding logic pull in the rest of the roles that it
requires.  Other barclamps that have roles that need ot be
automatically bound should add this flag.

#### cluster

Indicates that all noderoles for this role in a given deployment should be
bound as parents instead of just one.  This ensures that all instances of
a clustered service are up instead of just the first one.

It is needed to create linked set of services like the ceph-mons.
When we add a new monitor then we want all the children of the monitor
to be held until all the other cluster noderoles are updated together.

#### destructive

Indicates that this role is not idempotent, and that after it
transitions to active for the first time it should never be run
again. The only user of this flag is the provisioner-os-install role.

#### abstract

Indicates that this role exists only to be provided by other roles,
and cannot actually be bound to a node.

#### milestone

Indicates that role is a major delivery point in the orchestration 
lifecycle.  Milestone roles are exposed in the UI as selectable by
the user for adding to deployments.  They are generally only added
to deployments by users or during discovery.

> Noop and Network roles are almost always Milestones.

Non-milestone roles are typically added automatically when Crowbar 
resolves the dependency graph.

### Hooks / In-line Calls

Roles have several different hooks that are called as part of the
deployment and/or node role lifecycle.  These hooks allow you to
customize how a role behaves in the crowbar framework.  Hooks should
be kept short and fast so that they do not block the API or the UI --
if you want to do something that takes a long time, you should create
a new role.

#### Deployment hooks

There are two hooks for letting roles interact with deployment roles:

* `on_deployment_create`
* `on_deployment_delete`

They are called passing the relavent deployment as a parameter just after a
deployment_role is created or just before it is destroyed.

This function is import to set defaults, cleanup, validate and perform
other setups when a new role is added or removed from a deployment.
This can be very helpful to ensure that sane defaults are set and
items are cleaned up.

#### Node hooks

There are three hooks for letting roles take actions when nodes are created or deleted:

* `on_node_create`
* `on_node_update`
* `on_node_delete`

They are _for all roles_ in the system when a new node is added,
updated, or deleted.  The role does not have to be included in a
deployment or used in anyway for this hook to be called.  If a node
exists and implements this hook then it will get called when a node is
created or destroyed.

> It is expected that the code will scope correctly!

#### Noderole hooks

There are five hooks that get called as part of the state transitions
for node roles:

* `on_proposed`
* `on_todo`
* `on_transition`
* `on_active`
* `on_error`

Each of these hooks is called with the noderole as a parameter just
after the noderole transitions to the state for the hook in question.
